          <p class="mb-4">Ganiyat Adekunle is a young focused leader from Ibadan, Nigeria, who consciously and unconsciously inspires people
            around her.
            She is currently pursuing a degree in Computing at the African Leadership University
            (Mauritius). Prior to that, she had a diploma in Science Laboratory Technology and has experiences in 
            many fields such as medical, business and technology.
            Ganiyat, through her critical thinking, sees a future where the education system is improved through the use
            of technology allowing students to relate the knowledge they acquire within the four walls of the school to solve
            real-life problems. </p>
          <p> She is always charged towards taking up challenges and overcoming adversities. Ganiyat is also a proactive
            and strong advocate
            of SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 9(Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG 10 (Reduced
            Inequalities).
            She believes every child deserves a quality education and the world needs more critical thinkers and
            problem-solvers than ordinary earners.</p> 
            <p>She took an interest in Science and Technology because people in that field are considered smart. 
              As a fashion designer with interest in software development and AI, her goal is to make wearable technologies that are actually useful and not some 
              expensive ineffectual items like the common smart watches.<br> As the facilitator of the project, she designed the homepage, navbar, footer 
              and was in charge of scheduling and moderating meetings. She resolved conflicts in members' codes and made sure everyone is on track.
              She worked on the website integrations (chatbot and disqus). She gave constructive feedbacks where needed.
